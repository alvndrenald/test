## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

## üèÅ Getting started 
### üíæ Installation

Install Composer by downloading it From the [Official Website](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if you don't have it installed already

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Starting A Project
**Step 1**

Once you have Composer installed, open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Laravel project.

**Step 2**

Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:
```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name
```
Make sure to replace "project-name" with the name of the project you want to create.
After running this command, Composer will download and install the latest version of Laravel, and create a new project with the specified name in the current directory.

**Step 3**

Open up XAMPP and Start Up Apache and MySQL. You can download it from the [XAMPP Website](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) if you don't have it installed already

**Step 4**

Click the admin Button on the row of MySQL to open up PHPmyAdmin.

**Step 5**

Click new on the right hand side of the page to make a new database. Make sure to name it according to your project name you made using the terminal.

**Step 6**

After Making the new database, open up your project in VSC or directly from file explorer and open up the terminal and run the following command:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
This will migrate any database that was made in the folder into the database in PHPmyAdmin.

**Step 7**

You can then navigate into your created project directory and run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```
This will open a local server in which you can see your progress on your webpage.
